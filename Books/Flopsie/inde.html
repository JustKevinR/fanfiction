    <h1>Flopsie</h1>
    <div class="txt">
        Flopsie, an energetic young man in his best years, stood alone on the beach, gazing over the cobalt water with his determined rose depths. His plush hair rustled lightly in the ocean breeze. He tried to keep still despite his impatient excitement as he crossed one high-heeled foot behind the other. He wore a sanguine bikini top, his silvery back covered only by a thin bit of string, and a russet skirt that showed off his lily-white calves. His coral hair was trimmed short around his head, complementing his energetic lily-white visage. Beautiful wings sprouted from his back.

        His thoughts wandered to his days in Lara's company. It all started when he found himself in mortal danger. He truly feared that his life would end that day, but Lara was his unexpected savior. From then on, they were inseparable. They shared every part of their life with each other. That was how it was to this very day.
        Flopsie's ruby spheres spotted Lara further down on the beach, closer to the roaring sea. Her lovely hair was woven into a cinnamon braid. Her crystals were turned toward the ocean, hidden from Flopsie's sight, but he knew and loved their blameless copper hue. She was dressed in her usual everyday clothes. She had a toned but slender body covered with healthily color-touched lily-white skin. As Flopsie drew nearer, he caught a note of her familiar scent, a mixture of earthiness and sourness that was uniquely hers. He smiled to himself. It always reminded him of the time they shared. "Sweedy," he called, walking towards her.

        She turned around. A smile slowly made its way across her face. "Flops. You came."

        Flopsie smirked. "Good to see you. C'mon." They began their leisurely walk along the ocean's edge.
        "What have you been doing lately?" Lara asked.

        "You know. Sneaking arond. Saving the world. Sweeping a fine lady off her feet." Flopsie gave her a self-assured grin. "Other than that? Nothing important."

        She laughed and lightly shoved his arm. "Oh, you. You're such a..."

        "Rogue? Beast? Uncontested master of awesome?"

        "Rogue," she said lightly. "Definitely rogue."

        "That's why you love me."

        Lara humored him with a smile. Flopsie lapsed momentarily into an uncharacteristic silence. Lara angled her head in response. "What is it?"

        "I just keep thinking about how long it's been since we met, you know. All this time and I still remember it like yesterday."

        Lara shrugged and looked away. For a moment, Flopsie's heart hammered in his chest, but then she looked back toward him and he saw that she was blushing. "We've been through a lot together."

        Flopsie thought to himself that it was something like that, but all of a sudden the conversation wasn't as important to him as catching Lara's flushed face between his hands and pressing their lips together.

        Being the master of all awesome rogues, that was exactly what he did.

        When they parted, Lara's depths ran speechlessly across Flopsie's face. "We're in public," she whispered.

        "I know."

        Then she looped her arms around his neck, and did it again.
        While they walked down the beach, they spotted a natural alcove in the cliff bordering the beach.

        "Oh! Is that..." Lara began.

        Flopsie pressed a finger to her's lips and said, "Yeah. Shh. Come on."

        The natural alcove was covered in creeping vines with leaves and tiny flowers. The sound of the ocean echoed all around them, and tiny crabs burrowed into the sand at their approach.

        "It's beautiful, Flops."

        "I know," he murmured as he closed the distance between them. "So are you."

        Lara's lips were firm against his, and so too were her hands. Flopsie was arrested by the smell of her body.

        When Lara surfaced for air, she whispered, "Oh, Flops..."

        It was some time before they left the alcove.
        "The sunset is so beautiful, isn't it?"

        Flopsie lifted his head at Lara's words to behold the dying sun's sunset radiance. "It's nice."

        After a moment of silence, she asked, "Do you think we'll be together forever?"

        "I think we'll be forever," Flopsie murmured in response.

        "I would like that, Flops. Let's be together forever, then." Lara clutched his hand and sidled closer.

        Flopsie sighed with contentment and brought her closer. He gazed at the beautiful blonde rays of the falling sun, thinking about everything that had transpired on this day and all that would pass between them.

        "I love you, Lara."

        "I love you too, Flopsie."

        Their lips met, and coral strands met coffee ones, aflame in the dying light. The sand was their witness and the rumbling ocean their approving audience, and Lara, his eternally faithful lover. Flopsie thought to himself that nothing could be more perfect in the world.
