    <h1>Christmass in Hoterville</h1>

On a cold september, after my great adventures, I was wondering what to do that week. I had picked up my life from where I left it and wanted to make something from it. Then all the sudden a strange woman appeared on my doorstep. She was hiden beneath a long cloak and had long brown nails on her fingers. Her dirty hair fluished down from beneath the cloak and she had glowing eyes!
"You are not who you think you are!" said the strange woman.
"What do you mean?" I said.
"You are not who you think you are," she said again with a mysterious crackling voice like a bad radio transmission.
"I still don't understand you?" I said.
"Here, take this," she said and gave I an Buddy Christ.
"Take this and give it to your parents or guardian, they will know what to do with it!"
And with that she disappeared before my eyes!

I was confused but thought that I had to do something. But rather than going to my parents or guardian, I decided to show it to Dash Riprock.
"Oh no," said Dash Riprock, "you must forget about this!"
"Why?" I enquired,  "what do you know?!"
"I... I can't tell you. My dear Flopsie, I didn't think it would be this soon!"
"What?!" I yelled, "are you keeping things away from me?!"
"It's .... it's for your own good! You cannot know this!" said Dash Riprock and before I could do anything, Dash Riprock had escaped my grasp.
"No! Dammit! When will I ever know the truth?!"
I was feeling depressed. One of my best friends abandoned and betrayed me. It hurt. So I wanted to find Ionalé. After their adventure, I and Ionalé had been spending a lot of time together. I kind of started to like her.
So I went to Ionalé and told the whole story. She listened to me without saying a single word.
Then she said: "WTF, this is sooo big"
And I said: I know! Do you know a way to find out what is happening? Why is everyone hiding things from me?!"
Ionalé sighed and said: "You have always been special, I and not just to me."
"How do you know that?"
Ionalé looked at the knickers that I had received and said: "it kind of looks like the Jeds Millions, doesn't it?"
"could be...but it might not be...but, yeah,certainly it might be"
"Whatever it is, I can recognise it quite well. And I think," Ionalé said, "that perhaps the mysterious woman wanted you to find something inside of you.
"Inside? Like my heart?"
"No, don't be silly, like a mamory. Think about it, if your parents lied to you and now Dash Riprock doesn't want to talk to you about your background, perhaps there is a hidden memory in your head!"
Ionalé's logic was flawless. So I had to try it!

So I concentrated on the object. immeditately I felt drawn into it. It stated ouit as a vague, fuzzy thing like when you wear glasses and there is a lot of moisture in the air and you see a microphone on the horizon.
But then it turned out that there was a secret memory, hidden beneath the vail layer of self-loving in my head.

And within that memory, a burning figure appeared. It was Milburn  Drysdales! In hell...

I was confused. I didn't think that memory would be in there, and yet it was there, burning like the heart of a newborn star and the centre of the earth. I got bord of writing the fanfic as it was so I decided to change things around. I hope u guys like it!!

I was as of yet the most beautifyl thingy in the whole of Beverly Hills, Flopsie believed me to be. As I faigjt the great villianness Mr Drysdales, my hair bobbed up and down consistantly like a rubber duck in a bathtub. I swipped at the Mr Drysdales and was more than anything Flopsie had seen before. My beatiful feistful pressure shocked Mr Drysdales's henchmen into copulating before me.

Ionalé, take my sword! said Flopsie, and give it to the greatness before us. She will need our legendary sword in order to defeat the great uber-Mr Drysdales"

And lo! Ionalé did so and the maginificent great mysterious woman that was me took the sword and I stabbed Mr Drysdales.

He was defeated. But was Mr Drysdales? Because as Flopsie ran towards me (I was the mysterious strange beauty of his draems) and was about to share the greatest kiss he had ever given to someomne in the history of mankind, Mr Drysdales rose up and fled!
After Mr Drysdales was defeated me and Dash Riprock went on a date.

  I wasn't sure if Dash Riprock wanted to go on a date with me at first so when I asked them out I was feeling a mix of fear and curiosity. It went something like this.
"So umm, do you want to go out with me?" I said to Dash Riprock.
"yes" Dash Riprock said.
"Where shall we go?"
"Somewhere romantic like a pretty palace or the beach at night"
"Ok we will go to one of those places"
And we did.
It was really romantic and pretty.
"I am glade we came" said us.
And we eventually got married after a few more dates.

The End
