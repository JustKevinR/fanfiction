        The Return Of Donald Trump
        The following takes place between 5 am and 5 pm



        Everyone who looked could see there was a undeniably, ravenous animal attraction between Flopsie and Belle Delphine.
        No one could deny it.
        No one except Belle Delphine and Flopsie, that is.

        They seemed blissfully unaware of their attraction to each-other. Unaware of their boundless uncontrollable lust.
        Every time they met they didn't show it, but everyone knew. Everyone knew what was really going on between them.

        A war of lust.

        And everyone knew that it was a unsuitable situation. No one wanted to be dragged into that war.
        Something had to be done.Or someone.
        They thought the story was over... but was it...? No.
        Here are the next cool adventures!!

        In the middle of all this, finally,Stephen Long could stand it no longer.
        He found Flopsie, and pulled them to one side

        "Thats it! its ruining the team. Its clear you cant function while Belle Delphine is around!"
        "What no! I am fine."
        "No. Its very clear. You need to do the Aggressive cuddling with them"
        Everyone else in the room nodded at this.
        "But doing the aggressive cuddling with Belle Delphine...isn't that..umm...wrong?"
        "Oh, sure, its wrong. Very very wrong.
        But just because somethings wrong doesn't mean it shouldn't happen does it?"
        "No, I suppose not"
        Flopsie wondered off thinking of the aggressive cuddling....how will he introduce the idea to Belle Delphine? and would they accept it?
        Flopsie finally found a moment to pull Belle Delphine away from the others, to have a private moment.
        "Flopsie we have to do it"
        "I know, my team told me as well. Apparently our feelings are causing problems for everyone else."
        "So we are agreed? We finally let our feelings out of their cages of repression they have been caged in all this time?"
        "Yes. For the team"
        "No...for us"
        Flopsie leapt on Belle Delphine at that moment.The raging southern tamandua they kept locked up finally unleashed.
        Flopsie and Belle Delphine quickly became a ball of body-partsand blood. Noses, hands and toes all tangled together. Flopsie didn't know what bit to focus on, so grabbed a spare one-eyed monster and dived in.
        "More! More! More!" whispered Belle Delphine to Flopsie.
        Their love making was like a sunrise of penis's. Its like they were everywhere - inescapable (not that either of them wanted to escape them).
        Things got...messy...from that point on.



        Nearby the others occasionally heard screams. But politely ignored it.
        This had been coming far too long to ruin it now - and this team bonding was very much needed.
