On a cold september, after her great adventures, Loreley was wondering what to do that week. She had picked up her life from where she left it and wanted to make something from it. Then all the sudden a strange woman appeared on Loreley's doorstep. She was hiden beneath a long cloak and had long brown nails on her fingers. Her dirty hair fluished down from beneath the cloak and she had glowing eyes!
"You are not who you think you are!" said the strange woman.
"What do you mean?" said Loreley
"You are not who you think you are," she said again with a mysterious crackling voice like a bad radio transmission.
"I still don't understand you?" said Loreley.
"Here, take this," she said and gave Loreley an knickers.
"Take this and give it to your parents or guardian, they will know what to do with it!"
And with that she disappeared before Loreley's eyes!

Loreley was confused but thought that she had to do something. But rather than going to her parents or guardian, Loreley decided to show it to Hiroto Honda.
"Oh no," said Hiroto Honda, "you must forget about this!"
"Why?" enquired Loreley,  "what do you know?!"
"I... I can't tell you. My dear Loreley, I didn't think it would be this soon!"
"What?!" yelled Loreley, "are you keeping things away from me?!"
"It's .... it's for your own good! You cannot know this!" said Hiroto Honda and before Loreley could do anything, Hiroto Honda had escaped her grasp.
"No! Dammit! When will I ever know the truth?!"
Loreley was feeling depressed. One of her best friends abandoned and betrayed her. It hurt. So Loreley wanted to find Anzu Mazaki. After their adventure, Loreley and Flopsie had been spending a lot of time together. Loreley kind of started to like her.
So Loreley went to Flopsie and told the whole story. He listened to Loreley without saying a single word.
Then he said: "WTF, this is sooo big"
And Loreley said: I know! Do you know a way to find out what is happening? Why is everyone hiding things from me?!"
Flopsie sighed and said: "You have always been special, Loreley and not just to me."
"How do you know that?"
Flopsie looked at the knickers that Loreley had received and said: "it kind of looks like the Millennium Item, doesn't it?"
"could be...but it might not be...but, yeah,certainly it might be"
"Whatever it is, I can recognise it quite well. And I think," Flopsie said, "that perhaps the mysterious woman wanted you to find something inside of you.
"Inside? Like my heart?"
"No, don't be silly, like a mamory. Think about it, if your parents lied to you and now Hiroto Honda doesn't want to talk to you about your background, perhaps there is a hidden memory in your head!"
Anzu Mazaki's logic was flawless. So Loreley had to try it!

So Loreley concentrated on the object. immeditately she felt drawn into it. It stated ouit as a vague, fuzzy thing like when you wear glasses and there is a lot of moisture in the air and you see  a sussage on the horizon.
But then it turned out that there was a secret memory, hidden beneath the vail layer of self-loving in her head.

And within that memory, a burning figure appeared. It was Dark Bakura! In hell...

Loreley was confused. He didn't think that memory would be in there, and yet it was there, burning like the heart of a newborn star and the center of the earth.

Then our  gang knew what to do. They had to infiltrate Dark Bakura's forbodding  dungeons but in order to do so, they had to wear a disguise.

Loreley thought long and hard about the best disguise. They couldn't be too obvious or threatening because then Dark Bakura's guards could catch them. But they couldn't look too mundane because then Dark Bakura's guards would never let them in.
No... they had to be clever.

So Loreley came up with the best idea she had: they would dress up in gothic clothes!
Flopsie's friends were a little skeptic at the idea, but they all agreed it was for the best. But where would they get the best gothic clothing to surprise the guards with?
Anzu Mazaki knew exactly the best store to go: TrampVamp.

So they all went there in the deep of the night and smashed in the doorlock in order to enter the store. Flopsie deactivated the alarm and so they could easily get into the store and take whatever they need in order to infiltrate Dark Bakura's headquarters

Loreley put on nice tight redleather pants.  Then a black tanktop with My Chemical Romance's logo on the back  and on top of it all a nice long leather coat with blood-red streaks on the side. Then she painted her nails black and used red to draw little drops of blood on there
Anzu Mazaki wore a short red skirt with long black stockings that had holes where the toes would go so she could still paint her toenails. And she also had a corset made from unicorns gut that looked so awesome on her. Over this all she had a long leather coat. Flopsie also had cool clothes (A/N but I'm running out of imagination to describe it, so I guess he looked like Neo from the Matrix i know it's an old movie but those clothes look soooo cool)

Finally they were ready to face Dark Bakura!
And this is where the story ends...

It has come... to my attention... that some readers... don't like my art. They say that it's...it's all anti-semetic (sxuz me, but jews are like that!) and racist (I had a black classmate in my class once and he was really stupid lol) . That hurts me a lot. Really... a lot.
Do u know how long it takes me to write my stories? Do u think I like it being stuck at home with nothing to do but writing my soul into my art? My favourite show just ended and I was on team Jacob!

Writing is the only thing that makes me happy, but if that isn't good enough for u people, then I'm going to call it quits!
Yes, that's righr! I won't finish this story! You forced me into this :( HAPPY NOW?!!!!

I want to thank PrettySnape5 and Tinkersnuggums for beta reading, but I... I... I... just can't take it anymore.
So long internet. I WON"T MISS U!!
