    <h1>Nightmare on Kakariko Village</h1>
    <div class="txt">
        Now, this is a story all about how,
My life got flipped-turned upside down.
And I'd like to take a minute,
Just sit right there.
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Kakariko Village.

In west-Hyrule born and raised,
On the playground was where I spent most of my days.
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool,
And all doing some pot outside of the school.
When a couple of Ganons guys who were up to no good,
Started bleeding people in my neighborhood.
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared,
She said 'You're movin' with Malon and Jelly to Kakariko Village'.

I begged and pleaded with her day after day,
But she packed my suit case and sent me on my way.
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.
I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.

First class, yo this is bad,
Drinking beer out of a champagne glass.
Is this what the people of Kakariko Village living like?
Hmmmmm this might be alright.

But wait I hear they're naked,sexy, all that,
Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
I don't think so
I'll see when I get there,
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Kakariko Village.

Well, the blimp landed and when I came out,
There was a dude who like a cop - there with the Flopsie name out.
I ain't trying to get arrested yet,
I just got here,
I used my spinattack powers and  - like lightning, disappeared.

Then whistled for a cab and when it came near,
The license plate said fresh and it had Triforce in the mirror.
If anything I could say that this cab was rare,
But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, home to Kakariko Village'

I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8,
And I yelled to the Ganon 'Yo home smell ya later'
I looked at my kingdom,
I was finally there,
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Kakariko Village.
