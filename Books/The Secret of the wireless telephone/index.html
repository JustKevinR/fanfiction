        Hi!
        My name is Lorelei and I work for the NASA organisation.
        I am not the boss of NASA - thats Steve. However I am pretty important and normally Steve does what I say.
        Theres also my best friend, Jill, who also works for NASA. But they arnt in this story.
        One day we were all called to the meeting room at the top of NASA's biggest  tower.

        "Hi" I said.
        "I have called you all here today because I discovered something important" I continued.
        "It seems someone is trying to find the secret OG Ball and are going to use it to take over the world. We have to stop them!"

        "Thats bad...but is it the NASAs responsibility?" said Bob. He was always saying stuff like that to get out of work.

        "Yes. Of course it is. Because someone has to do something about it and we are an organisation that does stuff. Stuff that has to be done"
        said Steve.
        Everyone cheered his speech. He was good at speechs ever since I taught him to be.

        "I have found new information" said I.

        "It seems NASAs arch-enemy, MPAA, is upto their old tricks again. They are the ones after OG Ball!"

        "omg" said everyone.

        "We will have to send in our best secret agents" said Steve.
        "Thats you, of course, Lorelei"
        (I was also a secret agent,btw, but I told everyone as it makes the story easier)
        "I will assemble my team and leave tomorrow!"
        Now it was tomorrow and I was assembling my team.
        I first choose Flopsie, who I had called in specially as our outside expert.
        I then choose Lorelei as they were good at stuff.
        Also Bob from our private army so we had someone disposable who wouldn't be needed in future stories.
        I also choose myself, due to my all around abilities.
        After everyone was chosen me and Flopsie started planning.


        We were in the main planning room, there was a huge whiteboard, a projector, a screen, holograms and a blackboard.

        This was the room where NASA planned stuff.
        Much of the good work we did started here.
        Like the time we defeated Felusional and converted him to good and made him work for us.
        Or the time we saved the world from that rogue planet.
        Or the time we adopted a Manticore.

        I got out my pen and paper and started discussing the plan.

        "FELUSIONAL! FELUSIONAL! FELUSIONAL! FELUSIONAL! FELUSIONAL! FELUSIONAL! FELUSIONAL! FELUSIONAL! FELUSIONAL!
        "
        "DAIN! DAIN! DAIN! DAIN! DAIN! DAIN! DAIN! DAIN! DAIN! DAIN!
        " said Flopsie
        "NOMEY! NOMEY! NOMEY! NOMEY! NOMEY! NOMEY! NOMEY! NOMEY!
        "
        "INKY! INKY! INKY!
        "
        "NOMEY!
        " said Inky
        "FLOPSIE! FLOPSIE! FLOPSIE! FLOPSIE!
        "

        With that we all got onto the NASA Horse and Carriage and flue to the very foreign city of Greater Minneapolis!

        Once we got to Greater Minneapolis we decided to split up, with me and Flopsie finding where the OG Ball was hidden and the rest doing something which doesn't mater for the story.

        Me and Flopsie explored the town, checking out all the nightclubs and skyscrappers in Greater Minneapolis.
        Eventually, after I had done enough teamwork, I found where the OG Ball was hidden.
        It was inside a new church in the dead center of Greater Minneapolis.

        "FLOPSIE! FLOPSIE!
        "
        "INKY! INKY! INKY! INKY! INKY! INKY! INKY! INKY!
        "

        At that moment Felusional spotted us and came over.
        "LORELEI! LORELEI! LORELEI! LORELEI!
        "
        "
        " we said in shock..
        "INKY! INKY! INKY! INKY! INKY! INKY! INKY! INKY! INKY! INKY! INKY!
        "we are good guys"FLOPSIE! FLOPSIE! FLOPSIE!
        FLOPSIE! FLOPSIE! FLOPSIE! FLOPSIE! FLOPSIE! FLOPSIE! FLOPSIE! FLOPSIE! FLOPSIE! FLOPSIE! FLOPSIE! FLOPSIE!
        "
        Felusional grinned evily at me.
        "NOMEY! NOMEY! NOMEY! NOMEY! NOMEY! NOMEY!
        " said Flopsie.
        "FELUSIONAL! FELUSIONAL! FELUSIONAL! FELUSIONAL! FELUSIONAL! FELUSIONAL! FELUSIONAL! FELUSIONAL! FELUSIONAL! FELUSIONAL! FELUSIONAL!
        "
        "INKY! INKY! INKY! INKY! INKY!
        "
        With that we both Master Ball together right into MPAAs face.

        MPAA stagged backwards.
        "FLOPSIE! FLOPSIE!
        "

        "NOMEY! NOMEY! NOMEY! NOMEY! NOMEY!
        ".

         So we did it again. "INKY!
        "
        "
        "
        With that MPAA died.
        "INKY! INKY! INKY! INKY! INKY! INKY! INKY! INKY! INKY! INKY! INKY!
        "
         Me and Flopsie celebrated are victory. But it was only the first of many more to come. As there was more evils in the world then just MPAA and they will all be coming after the OG Ball now.
        So consider this the end of part 1 of Lorelei and Flopsies adventures!
