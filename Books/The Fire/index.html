        Today was the day of the big Gaming contest.
        The world championship!
        Twinkle Toes and Sokka  had made it into the final after a intensive competition which Flopsie won easily.

        "I am really proud of you Twinkle Toes! You were amazing!", said Katara.
        "You too Sokka you were also reasonable. "
        "Gosh thanks Katara" said Sokka

        Flopsie was still practicing Gaming as they walked along. They were taking a tour of the Gaming-ing Arena to prepare for the big day tomorrow.

        "Oh, look who it is, its the pathetic Flopsie and his pathetic friends. Your all pathetic!  "

        It was Inky Lord!

        "What are you doing here Lord Inky?" Flopsie said gruffly.
        "Why I am here for the contest."
        "Wahhhhaa?" said Sokka and Katara.
        "Yes I am taking part. I am going to win the world Gaming medal and there's nothing you pathetic people can do to stop me! "
        With that the Inky Lord marched off.

        "Inky Lord is taking part in the contest! I didn't know he  even did it."
        "He didn't. He must have learnt over the summer" said Flopsie "But....why?" he then queried quizzically.
        "I dont know" said Sokka ignorantly. He didn't know Flopsie was asking a rectangular question.
        "I guess we will find out tomorrow"

        With that they all went back to their rooms in the arena's hotel.

        (Fade out)

        The next day, Twinkle Toes was day dreaming.

        ...
        Katara snapped him out of it by bursting into his room.

        "Flopsie! The contest starts soon! Your late! Sokka and Lord Inky have already changed into their Gaminging kits! "
        "Oh, nooes I over slept! Thats not like me at all. "

        The Flopsie got dressed on the way down stairs, and skidding into the Arena.
        The audience was already there and he got  a big appose as he entered.

        "oh...you made it I seee. Had a nice night?" Inky Lord sneered.

        At that moment Flopsie realized he had been drugged! That explained the strange dreams last night. Lord Inky must have drugged him while they were talking the other day.
        It was too late to do anything about it though. Hehad to hope there was no more surprises.
        The starter walked on at that moment, told them to get ready.
        Inky Lord grinned at hero. Showing all their evil teeth
        "Blam!" The starter fired the starting pulse pistol and the contest had begun!

        Sokka took the early lead, but the Flopsie quickly caught up with the Gaminging. Sokka was sweating like mad trying to stay in the contest.
         Inky Lord was relaxed though - barely Gaminging at all!

        "Whats he upto? Its like he is not even trying"
        "And why does he care anyway? He always said Gaming was stupid "
        "I know, somethings not right" said Twinkle Toes while pulling of a particularly difficult Gaming move.
        Just then disaster striked!
        There was a loud bang BANG! and Sokka collapsed.
        Flopsie Gaminged backwards for a bit.

        "Sokka! Are you ok?"
        "urg...sabotage..." Sokka collapsed.

        "Who did it? Who...?"

        Inky Lord grinned.

        "WHO???"

        Just then the gong went. It was half-time.



        Back at the locker room, Katara and Flopsie were talking.  Sokka had been taken to the hospital.

        "How are you ever going to catch up?"  said Katara.

        Inky Lord was leading when half time went. Flopsies time spent seeing to Sokka had cost him the lead.

        "Its not important" said Flopsie.
        "Whats important is I know why Lord Inky wants to win the World Championship Gaminging contest. Its the prize."
        "hu" said Katara
        "I did some research and its really the meteorite iron! If he wins the contest they will give him it and there will be nothing we can do to stop him"
        "omg"
        "Also he was the one that sabotaged the poor Sokka!"
        "poor Sokka "
        "yes poor Sokka "
        "The contest doesn't matter any more, we must get that meteorite iron by winning the contest!'

        "But how? How are we going to win"
        "I have a plan" said Twinkle Toes

        Just then the horn sounded. Half time was over, and the final part of the Gaminging contest had begun!

        A dramaticness fell over the arena as they reentered.
        This was it - the final final.
        This was when Gaming-ing, also known as the sport of kings, would have its champion.
         In one corner, Flopsie, standing up for the rights of good and believing in bunnies.
        In the other corner, Inky Lord, addicted to destruction and vampire bats
        .

        The crowd cheered the Inky Lord.
         "Why are they cheering his?" asked Katara questioningly.
        "His rugged good looks probably"
        "Yes that must be it"
        "Dont worry I am sure Inky Lord will show their true colours soon.The next time Inky Lord murders someone the public will be on my side again!"
        "Oh, thats why I love you Twinkle Toes, you always see the bright side of things!"

        "Ok, the contest is about to start. Good luck my love!"
        (Oh, btw, Katara and the Flopsie are married after falling in love at the end of yesterday. Just FYI - A/N)

        And with that the Flopsie and Inky Lord started doing Gaminging again!

        Flopsie caught up with Inky Lord really easily because he was just better.
        The crowd was on the edge of their seat with the drama.

        However...as that moment The Flopsie and Inky Lord turned into a blind spot
        No one could see them, they were completely hidden.
        Unexpectedly Lord Inky stopped Gaminging and punched Flopsie in the chest.

        "What? ouch." said Flopsie shocked.
        Inky Lord then kicked The Flopsie while they were down.
         "ouch. Why are you doing this?"
        "So I can win, of course."
         Flopsie didn't fight back because punching and kicking as against the rules of the Gaming contest.
         "ha. ha. ha" said Inky Lord. He gave Flopsie an extra punchkick and then ran of, Gaminging at the same time.As Inky Lord became visable to the crowd again there were cheers.
        "urg." said Flopsie. "They still love him. But they dont know the truth. They dont know how horrible Inky Lord is. Not like me.
        But I cant let him win. I must somehow win"

         Flopsie struggled out back into the light again, still expertly Gaminging, despite being injured.
        Flopsie carried on bravely, but KATARA COULD SEE something was wrong. Doing some Gaming-ing herself so she could enter the area without breaking the rules, Katara went upto Flopsie.

        "Whats the matter love?" (A/N - Remember, they are married)
        "Lord Inky kicked and punched and hurt me when we were out of sight"
        "But that's against the rules!"
        "I know"
        "oh. no...."
        "what my love?" said Flopsie
        "Your almost about to reach another blind spot! He could do this to you again!"
        "And I cant even fight back because its against the rules!"
        "I know we could.." Katara whispered something to Flopsie
        "hmm..I think a better idea is..." Flopsie whispered something back to her.

        "Yes your right, that's better lets do that"

        As they went into the hidden spot The Flopsie was quickly beaten up again by Inky Lord.
        The Flopsie was in pain. Like always, this meant his plan was working.
        "Why are you grinning?" said Inky Lord who was grinning upto the point he saw Flopsie grinning. Now he wasn't grinning.
        "Look behind you!"
        Inky Lord turned around and saw...
           The contest judge - Toph
        "We saw you cheat"
         "Yeah, you broke the rules and they saw you"
        "umm...err....I didnt know it was against the rules"
        "Ignorance is no excuse. Your disqualified!"
        Inky Lord was taken away to the Gaming-ing Arena jail.

        "Flopsie wins by default!"
        The crowd cheered, now on his side!
        The other contestants who were competing cheered because Twinkle Toes was clearly the best!
        Everyone else cheered!

        Flopsie then accepted the trophy and took it home.
        It was kept safe on the shelf next to their other Trophies.

        -The End
