Good Omens : The The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter

We now turn out headlights to full beam in order to gaze forward though the mists of time.
The light from them reflects off, not a deer, but a scene 10 years from now - 1 decade into the future.

Flopsie enters the scene, but whats this? Anathema Device is there too.

"Do you remember that thing that happened 10 years ago? The one that seemed like it would split us apart forever, but instead brought us closer then ever? That brought us......to each-other?"

"The time with the The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter?"
"Yes!"
"Oh, yes right"

"Its hard to believe what happened isn't it? What happened and what it led to"
"Yes my sweetness" said Anathema Device, giving Flopsie a "special" kiss.
"Now that I have remembered it again I will never forget it."
"It was pretty life changing."

So we now dim our headlights and reverse drive back to the presence, the mists closing back around the future and the camera of our mind drawing back to the world we know of as the now.
In the beginning there was The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter its legendary power surrounded in mystery...


--
Meanwhile, back in the future, Flopsie and Anathema Device were enjoying each-other.
As the narrator, I will respect their privacy and not specify how- lets just say it involved dongs. Its certainly clear they were close.
Not just metaphorically but physically with their bodies as well.

Anathema Device was distracted though, thinking back to the past. We join her on her mid-aggressive cuddling flashback, a flashback to our story in the present......

Flopsie rememberd the abuse he suffered as a child.
His parents never loved him, Flopsie knew. Always telling him off for anything he did.
And that would continue until one day, Flopsie's parents were killed   in a car accident. He was then forced to live with his uncle and aunt.
They forced him to live in the basement. And every night he would cry himself to sleep as no one in the world loved him.
Flopsie was also forced to do all the work around the house. But still it wasn't enough to deserve his uncle and aunts love. And so soon, they send him to a orphanage.

Flopsie didn't think life could get worse, but there he learned that life still had more horror in store for him.
Because the orphanage turned out to be really a secret front for a highly criminal organisation! And they put all the children there to work in their factories and their mines.
And Flopsie too was set to work. Despite the horror of the orphanage, he was finally in a place where others were treated just as badly as he was. Hopefully, finally Flopsie could make some real friends, he thought.
But that thought too turned to merely a fantasy. As the kids soon saw that Flopsie was not like them. Flopsie was special. And the kids hated him for it.
And so every night, when the kids would return from the factories and mines, they would force Flopsie to work more. Or to do their beds. Or to clean the showers and the toilets.
And whenever something would go wrong, the kids said to the guards: "Flopsie did it!" and the guards, who also hated Flopsie for being so special, believed them and hurt Flopsie.

And so Flopsie thought that no one in the world would love him. Until one day, a organisation of superheroes attacked the criminals and freed all the kids.
And they also freed Flopsie!

And they said: "Don't worry, kid, we'll take care of you."
"We'll train you and you'll become a part of the family!"

Or will he?


Flopsie was then taken in by a super secret organisation, called Friends of the Earth. For a while, it looked like Flopsie was just at home.

Flopsie got to train with all the other secret superheroes. He was trained in all sorts of things, ranging from Business Studies to using the Flintlock revolver

The other recruits didn't want to socialise with Flopsie. They hated him for how quickly Flopsie mastered the tazer and how well trained Flopsie was in compare to the others. What Flopsie neglected to tell them was that the only reason why he was so good, was because of Flopsie s horrible childhood.

One day, Flopsie was called forward.
Flopsie had just succesfully accomplished the most difficult part of his training. So good, Flopsie had beaten the previous high score!
Flopsie knew that now that he had beaten the previous high score, he was sure to get a place on the greatest team the world had ever seen.
So Flopsie went to him commander-in-chief, Aziraphale.
But when Flopsie got there, suddenly there was more than Aziraphale. There were also others.

Flopsie said: "What's going on?"
"Don't worry," captain Aziraphale said. "It's all going to be all right."

But Flopsie knew this had to be a trap! That much he had learned from his horrible childhood.
Quickly Flopsie kicked the table into Aziraphale's chest. Anathema Device tried to stop him but Flopsie was too quick and took a gun from the wall (there were like loads of guns and other weapons displayed on the wall).
"I won't let you do this to me," Flopsie said gravely. "I will be free!"

The others didn't want to risk being shot. And Flopsie took the file from the desk that had his name on it. And then Flopsie ran. Away from Friends of the Earth and away from the other recruits.

And Flopsie was right not to trust them! For when he looked in the file, it turned out they were planning on selling Flopsie out to Greasy Johnson!

But what was Flopsie to do now? All alone in this world, who could Flopsie trust now?

Stay turned!!!
--
And now, with that, we once again turn our headbrains to the future, stepping forward down the road of time and walking for 10 years until we get to the place in time which this takes place.

Flopsie and Anathema Device were just finishing. Out of respect for their privacy I will not specify what they were just finishing.

"arg...that was good sex" said Anathema Device.
"yes, yes it was" said Flopsie.
"You seemed a little distracted near the end though. Not your normal energetic self"
"yes...sorry about that. I was thinking back to a decade ago, when I first realized my feelings for you even though I didn't know it at the time.
Its what opened my eyes to what I felt all along. The missing jigsaw piece to my heart in which you were the key to unlock"

"And our love grew together from that moment to blossom into the great tree that it is today"

"I love you Flopsie my irresistibleness".
"I love you too Anathema Device -my better half.

And they smiled the smile of lovers at each-other, as we fade out into the sunset.
Flopsie sat down on the pavement. It was raining loudly and people were hurrying down towards home, of course ignoring his sobbing.

The world had been unusually cruel to Flopsie. First his horrific childhood where he was treated like nothing more than a slave. Then the disappointing time at the Friends of the Earth. It all became a bit too much for Flopsie, so he put on his iphone player and listened to the soothing tunes, like Like a Virgin and A Whole New World .

Then all the sudden, footstepts approached Flopsie but he didn't hear it because of the music.
Flopsie then looked up and looked at a mysterious figure wearing a long rain coat.

"Whats wrong, kiddo," said the mysterious stranger.
"I'm fed up with life," said Flopsie. I'm so good at everything, but everyone hates me for it. I can't keep going anymore."
And then with the softest voice, Flopsie spoke the darkest truth: "I don't want to live anymore."

The stranger laughed loudly, "ohhohohoh, don't worry dear Flopsie. Life will turn out better for you."
"How do you know," Flopsie asked.
"Because the world hates me too," the stranger said and with one swoop the stranger removed his coat. It was Greasy Johnson!

"OMG," Flopsie said outraged.
"Calm down, young one," Greasy Johnson said. "I too am misunderstood."

"Oh, I suppose that oculd be true," said Flopsie.
"Now, come with me," Greasy Johnson said and reached out for Flopsie. "Let me take care of u. We're sole mates, you and I. The world is against us, but together we can fight for our freedom!"
"For freedom!" Flopsie said as he accepted Greasy Johnsons hand.

And together they went off. Flopsie was finally happy.
