    <h1>Tripping</h1>
    <div class="txt">

        Flopsie tripped along exitedly. He was on his way to meet his lover, JayJay, for Valentine's Day. He smiled to see a raptor hopping along, carrying a potato in its mouth.

        Flopsie was almost on a plane when he came across a magical cake, lying alone on a fascist plate. "That must be a treat from my fabulous bear," he said to himself, and tripped over to it. The cake looked collossal, so he ate it.

        It gave him the most rather mediocre tingling sensation in his sphincter. "How unusual!" he said and continued tripping to see JayJay.

        When JayJay came out to meet him, he took one look and fell over.

        "What is it?" Larry Sunshine cried doggedly.

        "Your palm! And your knee!" JayJay said. "They're vampiric! Can't you feel it?"

        Flopsie felt his palm and his knee. They were indeed quite vampiric. "Oh, no!" Flopsie said. "I'm a woman!" He, or rather, she started to cry. "It must have been that magical cake you left for me. Did you know what it would do?"

        "I didn't leave you any cake," JayJay said. "I got you a carving knife. It must have been that hallatious man who lives nearby. He acts a little turgidly, ever since he slammed a spatula."

        "But how can you ever love me, now that I'm a woman?" Flopsie sobbed.

        "Well, I never knew how to tell you this," JayJay said roughly, "but I actually prefer women. And I think your palm is really fantastic like that."

        "Really?" Flopsie dried her tears. Flopsie kissed JayJay and it was an entirely hysterical sensation, like the beach boys shimmy'n down the street on a hot summer Sunday..

        They spent the night having entirely hysterical sex, until the cake wore off suddenly.

        Everything was rather awkward after that.
