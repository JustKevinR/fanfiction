    <h1>Flopsie meets Legolas</h1>
    <div class="txt">


        Nothing was darker than the stars, the old sage had told Flopsie.

And he also told Flopsie that virtue is the best property in a person. And that Flopsie could be the legendery Chosen One that the prophesies of old and dank and darkness had spoken about.

Oh yes, the Prophecy. That what had made Flopsie lay awake at nights. Of course  Emma had asked what was up with Flopsie.

"Of course," Flopsie would always say, "there is nothing going on, dear. Go back to sleep." And in their minds they'd fill in "You don't have to worry about the terrible burden I will have to carry for the rest of my life"

Because everyone knows, prophesies have a nasty way of coming true. And this one was about to come true spectacularly.
In the darkness of that night, away from the preying eyes and ears of those who would judge, some strangers slipped by unnoticed.

But they were not strangers, they knew each-other. And they knew each-other much closer then any of their friends did realize.
They knew each-other both inside and out. But their friends did not know this. Their friends could not know. Their friends should not know this.
Nor could they know. Because it was night, and thus away from their viscous, judging eyeballs.

"Is it safe?" said the first stranger, who was not a stranger to the other stranger but will remain a stranger to us for the moment.

"I think so. Its dark so none of the others should see us here, even if they are nearby. I think our secret is safe."

"Good. I couldn't take their judgement right now. My life is too stressful as it is. If it wasn't for you I don't know what Id do."
"Don't worry Flopsie, I will always be here for you - waiting in the dark"
"Thanks, Lady Finarfin. I will always be in the dark for you too"

With that the two shadows embraced - an embracement in the night full of passion and romance.


It looked like Sauron had sought Flopsie out! Ever since Flopsie's parents told him that he was in fact a half vampire (or a dhampire), he had feared being discovered by The lord of Morder especially after Flopsie remembred the terrible secret of his past.

Emma looked with concerned at Flopsie, "what is wrong Flopsie?"

Flopsie did not wait to answer her. He turned on one of his new found sexual vampire powers and listened to Sauron's commands.
The man of lies was commanding his lackeys to search Flopsie out. After villain had given them cookies andmanically asked  The lord of Morder had discovred the truth behind Flopsie! And he told his henchmen that he had.
"I have discovered the secret behind Flopsie's percentage" Sauron told his henchmen.

His lackeys smiled wickedly and took their weapons and rushed into the shopping centre . They had no concern for any of the shops .
Flopsie and Emma and Legolas faught like lions that were fighting among each other for the last scrap of meat and mannished to defaecate most of the henchmen.

But then The lord of Morder stapped forwar and spoke: "I know your secret!"
Then Legolas said: "How do you know about Flopsie being a half vampire (a/n: or dhampire, really!)?"
The lord of Morder laughed and said: "you just told me! But also, I read it on Flopsie's facebook!"

Flopsie gasped, he thaguht that he had posted it only for friends and not public! Flopsie had to be careful with his privacy settings because thye keep changing all the time (a/n: urrrgh, so annoying!)
But Sauron did nothing but launching. The tempter then said: but that is not what I had discovered!"
Oh no! both Legolas and Emma gasped but Flopsie could only think of. They did not know the truth. That Flopsie was really rapped by Sauron before Flopsie even knew of Sauron's name!

"I know that it was you so long ago who I raped before me and did everything that I had ever wanted to do with sucgh a fine pretty piece of meat like you!"

Oh no! gasped Emma and she felt really bad for Flopsie because even though she knew that Flopsie didn't love her and was really depressed, she really didn't expect this.
And Legolas was also shocked because he knew the Galadriel and Boromir knew a great secret that he didn't know, he still didn't know it was going to be this kind of secret!
Flopsie felt very depressed all the sudden. He lost the will to fight and dropped his weapon before Sauron and villain laughed very loudly.
The lord of Morder then said: "I have you now under my omplete spell like I had that so long ago!"


'"I Love you Morningstar Lightbringer" Legolas said, in an emotional, yet tough voice.

For a moment time seemed to slowed down. Flopsie wondered why. Flopsie turned around slowly (due to the time seeming to have slowed down).
Then the explanation - The strong woman was secretly looking at him. Looking at him in that special way.
Flopsies soul lit up like a beacon in the night - even though it was day.

In all of this. In all of this mess. They had eachother, even if eachother was the only ones that knew.
The strong woman turned away at that moment - Time jumped back to normal as Flopsie was no longer transfixiated by The female Elf.
Fortunately no one else had noticed.
Some time later in their secret hide-away ;

"I am glade we found a way to survive all that and still be together"
"Yes, our plan seems to have worked despite all the events"
"Do you think anyone spotted us?"
"No"
"No"
"Yes"
Morningstar Lightbringer emerged from the shadows of the darkness.
"I know everything" she said.
Flopsie and The strong woman gasped. Their secret was finally revealed!

"I dont love The female Elf like you do" said Morningstar Lightbringer "but I have always lusted a bit after them. So you see if The female Elf spends the night with me - I will never tell anyone."
Flopsie breathed a sigh of relief. That was, after all, a reasonable request. They agreed to the bargain.
"Phwee...thats something we can go along with" said The lady of Lothlorien relieved.
Morningstar Lightbringer was happy, and Flopsie and The female Elf thus got to live happily ever after together. With no one but Morningstar Lightbringer and themselves ever knowing.
Flopsie followed the screaming till he reached his brother, who was being tortured.

 "Flopsie! Over here! quick! help me! It hurts"

Then Flopsie saw the final boss, who had been torturing his brother.
Flopsie shot bullets from his throwing knifes really fast and the bullets went WAM! and hit Sauron in the eyes and then he couldnt see.

Flopsie said "Eat This!" and punched the man of lies in the eye and the the man of lies went to his knees.

Flopsie said "He is dead now, you is safe"
"Thank you!"
"Glade I could help, brother"
"But you should come earlier next time!" and they laughed.
