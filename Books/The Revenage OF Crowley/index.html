    <h1>The Revenage OF Crowley</h1>
    <div class="txt">

        Flopsie sat at the bar. It was empty save for him . Even the owner had already left him alone. Just Flopsie and the wiskey in his glass.

        Flopsie's friends had tried to stop him from going, but after that.... that event... Flopsie could no longer stay.

        Thinking about it made his eyes well up and to prevent bursting out in crying he lifted the wiskey and gulped it down. The burning liquid warmed his throat and heart. It was the only comfort Flopsie still had in this world.

        Flopsie tried to take his mind of the present. To slip into the past rather then wallow in sorrow...

        ...but it didn't work. Flopsie was still just at a bar. Keeping the whisky company.

        Suddenly the door opened behind him. Footsteps. Then a figure sat down next to him and took the bottle.
        "Long time," spoke Castiel and he poored himself a glass as well.
        Before Flopsie realised it, his rage took over and he lunched at Castiel. He ended with punching Castiel in the face.
        "I deserved that," Castiel said and took a gulp from his whiskey.
        "Go away," Flopsie said.
        "Not before you hear my offer," Castiel said.
        "I don't want to hear about it." Flopsie spoke. He really didn't want anything to do with Castiel, not after... that. "I don't want anything to do with you... not after... that."
        "Dammit, that wasn't your fault," Castiel, "It was none of our fault."
        "Yes it was, it was my fault. I could have stopped it." Flopsie said, "I SHOULD HAVE STOPPED IT FROM HAPPENING."
        "Calm down, Flopsie," Castiel, "It wasn't your fault... that wasn't your fault."
        But no matter what Castiel said, Flopsie still felt that that was his fault...
        "I need you," said Castiel. "Just one more time. Just one more job and I'll leave you alone."
        Oh lonelyness, that would be nice. No one around. No one to remind Flopsie of...that.
        "One more job," Flopsie muttered. "Alright. One more job it is."
        And with that, he gulped down the remaining whiskey. Time for action!
        ---
        Meanwhile, Flopsies mind was wondered back to the past. The good old days....
        It was Crowleys graduation party, which everyone was invited too.
        The party was awesome as always, because Dean was hosting it.

        Flopsie was pretty drunk that day. He had already punched a bunch of people. Castiel a few times.Because He is stupid.Blood was spilled. But that was normal in this sort of party.As was the pile of bodies.
        If Flopsie was honest, He couldn't remember much that happened.
        Only something about a mercenarys,a goat and a pair of scissors.

        There was one thing that stuck in Him mind though. Something He would never forget.
        The Dark Flopsie.
        The Dark Flopsie was wearing a Crowley mask that night.
        It was one of the most erotic costumes at the party.
        Everyone had come as something or someone else.
        No one could recognize anyone else because everyone had bits of their bodies covered;

        DEAN WAS DRESSed as THE DARK FLOPSIE.
        THE DARK FLOPSIE WAS DRESSed as CHARLIE.
        CHARLIE WAS DRESSed as Flopsie.
        Flopsie was dressed as Crowley.
        And Crowley was dressed as a hand mirror.

        Flopsie had no idea which person The Dark Flopsie was! At the top they were strangers. But they would become much more!
        Flopsie was instantly attracted to The Dark Flopsie in Her costume. The way She moved. The way She talked.The way She flicked Her hair.
        The Dark Flopsie was doing a Karaoke number.
        It was "500 miles". And She was awesome.
        She sung like they were possessed.The audience was transfixated by The Dark Flopsie.
        Underwear was chucked at The Dark Flopsie.
        Flopsie was soooo turned on.
        Despite His crushing shyness,and fear of people judging him,Flopsie got up and sang too.
        When The Dark Flopsie was singing 500 miles it was like the words spoke to Him. The Dark Flopsie seemed to be addressing each word of the song just to Him. The room faded away and it was just the two of them. No one else in the world.
        They gazed into eachother eyes as The Dark Flopsie put Her soul into the last lyric.
        Then silence.

        Suddenly, Flopsie was woken out of the flashback by current events!
        ---

        Then our sexybloodthirsty gang knew what to do. They had to infiltrate Crowley's   phallic shaped volcano but in order to do so, they had to wear a disguise.

        Flopsie thought long and hard about the best disguise. They couldn't be too obvious or threatening because then Crowley's guards could catch them. But they couldn't look too mundane because then Crowley's guards would never let them in.They couldn't go naked, as they were likely to be distracted.By Sex.
        No... they had to be clever.

        So Flopsie, after a suggestion from The Dark Flopsie, came up with the best idea he had: they would dress up in gothic clothes!
        Flopsie's friends were a little skeptic at the idea, but they all agreed it was for the best. But where would they get the best gothic clothing to surprise the guards with?
        The Dark Flopsie knew exactly the best store to go: TBurtons.

        So they all went there in the dread of the night and took out the patrolling store guards with their silenced cross bows, 'paw!' 'paw!', leaving only a single red dot in their forehead  Dean deactivated the alarm and so they could easily get into the store and take whatever they need in order to infiltrate Crowley's headquarters

        As normal, Flopsie couldn't help but get embarrassed about getting naked in front of The Dark Flopsie and Dean in a store at night.He swallowed his blushes and got on with it though.
        Flopsie put on nice tight redleather pantsthat made his trouser lump stand out in an eye-pleasing way. .  Then a black tanktop with My Chemical Romance's logo on the back  and on top of it all a nice long leather coat with blood-red streaks on the side. Then he painted his nails black and used red blood to draw little drops of blood on there
        The Dark Flopsie wore a short red skirt with long black stockings that had holes where the toes would go so she could still paint her toenails. And she also had a corset made from dragons gut that looked so awesome on her. Over this all she had a long leather coat. Dean also had cool clothes (A/N but I'm running out of imagination to describe it, so I guess he looked like Neo from the Matrix i know it's an old movie but those clothes look soooo cool)

        Finally they were ready to face Crowley!


        ---
        The next time they saw eachother The Dark Flopsie winked at Flopsie, remembering what happened at the party.Flopsie blushed.
        Some of the others giggled. Did they know? Flopsie didn't care.
        ----
        ---
        Flopsie had some time before he had to do anything, so He decided to have another flashback.

        It was just after the Karaoke. They had stepped of the stage to loud applause and were now looking at eachother.
        "Hi" Flopsie said, meekly.
        "Hay" The Dark Flopsie said, also meekly. Their confidence from moments ago had evaporated like alcohol.
        "Do you want too..."
        "maybe.."
        "ok then."
        So they walked to the cloakroom.
        It wasn't long before their lips were together. Flopsie couldn't remember who made the first move.
        He did remember the taste though. The taste of The Dark Flopsie.
        The Dark Flopsie tasted like kumquat on a winter noon.
        Refreshing and salty but also a bit sour.
        What had they been eating? Flopsie tried to work out it. It took much tung work.
        After a few minutes mouth to mouth pot holing, The Dark Flopsie guessed what Flopsie was doing.
        "I had purple mangosteen for lunch."
        "oh"
        "you dont have to stop though"
        "oh. Good!" Flopsie said, with great relief.
        They finally drew away after what seemed a whole decade but was only mere minutes.
        The taste of The Dark Flopsie's lips still lingered in Flopsie's mouth as they finally looked upon each other with new eyes.
        Relieved sighs came from both of them as both embraced, The Dark Flopsie snuggling against Flopsie's neck as he snuggled upto The Dark Flopsie's torso.



        The Dark Flopsie went further by clutching Flopsie with his fingers, pulling at the fabric of His slacks to feel what was underneath.

        The telltale shape in His leggings stood out between them, especially with the weight it had against Flopsie's thigh.

        The Dark Flopsie moved over Flopsie's body like a serpent and lovenly nuzzled at a peaked abbs.
        Flopsie liked this a lot and started making a lot of noise. The Dark Flopsie joined in. "Owwww...Ahhh...MAHAhhhEEkkk...aakk"
        It got pretty noisy from that point on. Both of them had a lot of fun and made a lot of noise!. Flopsie sounded like 4x4 ! The Dark Flopsie sounded like a heard of Cetaceanss on drugs. They had a lot of..."fun".
        "My groinal area are hurting...can we stop? 12 times is enough surely?" The Dark Flopsie said, pleading.
        "No...MORE MORE MORE" said Flopsie, with apparently an insatiable apatite
        The Dark Flopsie finally head butted Flopsie to get Him to stop.
        "Sorry about that, I got a little carried away" said Flopsie.
        "Thats ok I.....enjoyed it." said The Dark Flopsie blushing in the way they always did.
        "Tomorrow?"
        "Yes" said The Dark Flopsie.
        "I'll bring some of my toys next time for us to play with" said Flopsie.

        And with that they left the cloakroom and returned to the party. The months that followed were fun but eventually they broke up and became enemies.


        ---
        The next morning we got evreything ready and went out to infiltrate Crowley's base. And with my complex plan and sexy disguise, we managed to obliterate their unstoppable force.

        We then defeated Crowley and everyone rejoiced.

        I came back from the celebrations to find Flopsie and Castiel in my bedroom naked.

        "The Dark Flopsie said Flopsie", "You need to make a choice."

        Manly Castiel believed the same thing," he said: I believe the same thing. It cannot go on like that.

        He was right of course, it couldn't go on like this. I had to make a choice and the choice was...

        "I pick," I said with all the pain in the wolrd in my heart because I knew that excluding one of the other was a true betrayal of my feeling. And when I looked at them, I saw them both waiting my very breath: "I pick Both of you. I can't choose. And this is the modern age. I should be able to pick both of you! There is enough for both of you to love me!"

        And they recognised my wisdom and in the end, everything was right. We all lived happily togethre after all in my new hut.
