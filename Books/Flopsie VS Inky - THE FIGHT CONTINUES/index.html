    <h1>Flopsie VS Inky</h1>
    <div class="txt">

       Hi!
       My name is Sakura and I work for the Boy Scouts organisation.
       I am not the boss of Boy Scouts - thats Steve. However I am pretty important and normally Steve does what I say.
       Theres also my best friend, Jill, who also works for Boy Scouts. But they arnt in this story.
       One day we were all called to the meeting room at the top of Boy Scouts's biggest  tower.

       "Hi" I said.
       "I have called you all here today because I discovered something important" I continued.
       "It seems someone is trying to find the secret Mutant Growth Hormone and are going to use it to take over the world. We have to stop them!"

       "Thats bad...but is it the Boy Scoutss responsibility?" said Bob. He was always saying stuff like that to get out of work.

       "Yes. Of course it is. Because someone has to do something about it and we are an organisation that does stuff. Stuff that has to be done"
       said Steve.
       Everyone cheered his speech. He was good at speechs ever since I taught him to be. (I am also the speech writer for the president,btw)

       "I have found new information" said I.

       "It seems Boy Scoutss arch-enemy, Illuminati, is upto their old tricks again. They are the ones after Mutant Growth Hormone!"

       "omg" said everyone.

       "We will have to send in our best secret agents" said Steve.
       "Thats you, of course, Sakura"
       "I will assemble my team and leave tomorrow!"
       ---
       Flopsie stopped and gazed into space.
       Oh no.
       It was happening; He couldn't help thinking about Jelly again. He tried not too. Desperate to avoid the thoughts that could not be, no, - would not be- held back.
       But like dozens of unstoppable lackyss they came creeping forward  till they filled His brain;

       Jellys smile shined like water, as impressive as a skyscrapper, it filled the palace and Flopsie was helplessly but willingly absorbed into them.

       Jellys eyes were like oranges.If you rolled them they would go quite far.

       Jellys legs were like a tree. Straight and tight.

       Jellys chest was like a Mammalss. Powerful and impossible to ignore.


       How could Flopsie not be helpless in the face of that?.
       I mean, sure, Flopsie and Jelly had sex with eachother before, when they met at a club once, but it was just a casual thing. One of many that night.
       Before things got too messy Flopsie snapped out of it. But the thoughts of Jelly would be back. Would He be able to resist next time?
       ---
       Now it was tomorrow and I was assembling my team.
       I first choose Flopsie, who I had called in specially as our outside expert.
       I then choose Sakura as they were good at stuff.
       Also Bob from our private army so we had someone disposable who wouldn't be needed in future stories.
       I also choose myself, due to my all around abilities.
       After everyone was chosen me and Flopsie started planning.

       ---
       Interlude:
       Flopsie was finding it really hard to concentrate at this movement his thoughts kept trying to think of Jelly. Despite what was happening, it was hard to focus!
       ----

       We were in the main planning room, there was a huge whiteboard, a projector, a screen, holograms and a blackboard.

       This was the room where Boy Scouts planned stuff.
       Much of the good work we did started here.
       Like the time we defeated Inky and converted him to good and made him work for us.
       Or the time we saved the world from that rogue planet.
       Or the time we adopted a Manticore.

       I got out my pen and paper and started discussing the plan.

       "I have been doing research and stuff in our database library. The Mutant Growth Hormone is hidden under Beijing"
       "Ahh...it makes so much sense! Why didn't we think of it before!" said Flopsie
       "Because Boy Scouts has access to a lot of secret files and shit"
       "oh, right, of course"
       "Now what?" said Jelly
       "Now we leave for Beijing!"

       With that we all got onto the Boy Scouts Blimp and flue to the very foreign city of Beijing!

       ---
       And then, at the worst possible moment. It happened. Again.
       Flopsie gazed at Jelly.
       It was impossible to resist this time. Like a scooter Flopsie was pulled towards Jelly. It was a like coup de grï¿½ce in a war. It was a like a webley revolver piercing through His heart. (and other lower regions of the body) It was a like magnets.
       There was No resisting. No mercy. No Pants. No longer anything else mattered.

       Jelly looked shocked and then...and then...not shocked. She had known all along.
       Of course. How could Flopsie have been so stupid? Those long looks at eachother,the times they gazed at the stars together, the candle lit dinners. The steamy showers.. The non stop sex.
       It wasn't just friendship. It never was. It was more and Jelly had known all along.
       "I knew" Jelly said.
       "oh" Flopsie said, realizing all this for the first time.
       But there was more...Jelly wasn't pulling away. She was pushing tighter. Holding Flopsie like a wild meerkat.
       At some point their clothes came off.
       They got ripped in the process of the pashioning
       He didn't care. This is what He had needed for so long. too long. Week. maybe more.
       But this was now now.
       Flopsie and Jelly together at last!
       They canoddled like lovers and made love with their naughty bits.
       They took it in turns inserting their bits into eachother. Flopsie inserted his bit into Jelly. Then Jelly inserted her bit into Flopsie. They repeated this a few times.(Toys were used)


       Afterwards (when they had finished cleaning their bits)they looked at eachother longingly and had a cigarette.
       But they knew they must leave.
       They didn't want anyone to see.

       Flopsie took one last look at Jelly.
       "Goodbye my snuggly one"
       "Love you too, my one and only Flopsie"

       And then they departed.
       ---
       Once we got to Beijing we decided to split up, with me and Flopsie finding where the Mutant Growth Hormone was hidden and the rest doing something which doesn't mater for the story.

       Me and Flopsie explored the town, checking out all the nightclubs and skyscrappers in Beijing.
       Eventually, after I had done enough teamwork, I found where the Mutant Growth Hormone was hidden.
       It was inside a new church in the dead center of Beijing.

       "Look! Its the Mutant Growth Hormone!"
       "But Inky is here already! whats going on?"

       At that moment Inky spotted us and came over.
       "Mahaha it was me! I was Illuminati all along!"
       "What?" we said in shock..
       "While you and your goody-two-shoes Boy Scouts were being all 'la-de-da' "we are good guys" la-de-da', I was being Illuminati!
        And now I have the Mutant Growth Hormone there is nothing you can do to stop me! Even with Flopsie to help you! your powerless"
       Inky grinned evily at me.
       "oh, noees Sakura, what will we do now?! " said Flopsie.
       "Dont worry, we still got time. Activating the Mutant Growth Hormone takes time. If we both wood chucking together we can take Inky/Illuminati out!  "
       "On the count of 3! 1 2 3 GO!"
       With that we both wood chucking together right into Illuminatis face.

       Illuminati stagged backwards.
       "Nooooo you cant!"

       "Again quick!  while they are stunned".

        So we did it again. "Bam! Pow!"
       "Noooo!"
       With that Illuminati died.
       "We did it! Illuminati is defeated once and for all! Thank you Sakura!"
        Me and Flopsie celebrated are victory. But it was only the first of many more to come. As there was more evils in the world then just Illuminati and they will all be coming after the Mutant Growth Hormone now.
       So consider this the end of part 1 of Sakura and Flopsies adventures!
