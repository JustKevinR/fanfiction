    <h1>Return Of Flopsie</h1>
    <div class="txt">
        ---
        A little Later, Felusional was taking a shit.
        She was having trouble though.
        It felt like days passed and still no sign of release.

        "Help..Errrr... ahhhh! Christ! when is this epic poo gonna pass!?" Felusional exclaimed, Her face wincing with effort.
        She made every effort in her little girl body to expel this demon thing from her curvy back side.

        By this point Felusionals poo-tubes were all bent out of shape. It has been a bad day.
        Just as Felusional was going in for another push..
        Without warning the bathroom door suddenly burst open unexpectedly. Yeepers!

        "Well hello...Felusional" a enticing voice gasped from the doorway.

        A mysterious figure posed leaning against the door frame. His deep, sensual voice which Felusional knew immediately. Her mind began racing and a nervous sweat began pouring from her face.

        "Flopsie... is that you? wha- what are you still doing awake...?"

        He appeared in nothing but a towel, seemingly ready to take a steamy shower.
        However He couldn't with Felusional near by....they were like family now.Flopsie was like Her uncle.
        Any sane person would never allow their own uncle to see them in the nude. Right? RIGHT!!?! SHIT!"

        "Oh I felt dirty from questing all day...ya ever feel dirty Felusional?"
        "Y-Yes, I mean NO! NO! NO! Never" Felusional shrieked, She became so immensely worked up he cleaned her colon clear of the demon feces that had been clogging it. His voice also cracked like he was 13 again, but in comparison to the loud flatulence she just unleashed, who cares? Flopsie heard though, and giggled like a adorable little girl laugh. It sent tingles all up Felusional's spine.
        "Oh you've always been the shy one in the family, Felusional..."

        Felusional was not shy, at all. She defeated Mello and blew up His evil machines for Christ's sake! and now she suddenly found herself speechless. Was She going to see his metaphorical uncle literally naked? Little did he know, that was merely a sprinkle on the cream-cake of excitement that was to come.

        "..the shy and excitable one." said Flopsie finishing the sentence seductively.

        "Wh-what the..." and before Felusional could send the third word out of Her mouth..

        ..Flopsie's towel dropped to the floor,setting his swingy bits free into the mist of the shower.
        Felusional noticed everything on him instantly. His squishy rump,his inexplicably straight chest hair and the tiny thingy colored birth mark on his ass, which made Her feel it.

        Still, the sight of his near perfect body caused Felusional to feel funny in places she had never felt before.

        "hehe oh my Felusional...you're more impressive than I thought."
        "uh... ye-yeah, th-thaaanks Flopsie, you're cute too." THIS IS SO WRONG! It raced through her head at lightning speed. But the beautiful, wet, soapy body that stood before her spoke otherwise. Him shapely body was everything Felusional could want ...in a body to make use of. Yet did family like relationship matter?..
        ...
        ...
        Or...did it make it better?

        But just as Felusional was commiting. Commiting to a path that they couldn't go back from.


        Flopsie burst into the toilet!


        "What are you too upto?"
        "Err..nothing" said Felusional as she causally slipped her pants back on.
        Flopsie, who Flopsie didnt notice, picked up his towel and backed out slowly.
        "Really?"
        "I was just having a shit...see?" Felusional gestured to her shit.
        "Oh, thats a shit all right!  One hell of a shit!
        Ok, if your done we better go"
        So Felusional put her other pants on and left. She had a serious case of blue balls, but at least her anus didnt feel so bad now.
        As she walked out Flopsie whispered one word. A word fall of hope.
        "Later"
        Felusional Giggled.
        Fortunately, their traveling companion was as oblivious as ever, and didn't notice.
        ---
        It was a dark and stormy night...
        Flopsie winked at Felusional when no one else was looking.
        "Later" he mouthed at her silently so no one could hear.
        ---
        It was a darj and snowy night. Flopsie had been bored, so bored, you wooldn’t bleve it.
        He had been there together in the room with Ryuzaki and Misa Amane. Normally they could perfectly entertain each other, but not this time. And to make matters worse, it was almost impossible to go to town. It was too snowy, too dark.

        “Urgh,” said Ryuzaki, “I wish Mello would attack. At least we’d have something to do.”
        Misa Amane agreed, “I agree,” she said and started throwing mobile phone at the wall, just to catch it again when it bounced off. “Uuuurgh,” she then said as well, because she agreed with Ryuzaki, “Don’t you know anything to do, Flopsie?”
        "Well, I could do you again." Flopsie said .
        Misa Amane giggled at Flopsie's irrelevence "Nooooo, you naughty thing, something else!

        Flopsie’s gaze went down the room, past stick and a stack of alarmclocks. Then His eye fell onto a lone empty bottle  they had used the evening before.

        I know,” said Flopsie, “How about we play...............spin...the....BOTTLE!”

        “What a superb idea”
        “Oh year!”
        Kiyomi Takada and Ryuk also peaked up “Yeaaaah!”

        So they all sad down and Flopsie took the bottle first. Hilariously, it landed on Ryuk, but Flopsie thought Ryuk was quite a bit too creepy and really didn't want to kiss the man. He hoped the others might have mistook it for landing on Misa Amane, but judging the howls of laughter and the rising anticrepation in the room, they probably didn't.

        "But but dont you all see it really landed on Misa Amane?"
        "Laaawl no, u shuld kiss Ryuk," said Misa Amane. The fact that she said it made Flopsie feel rejected :(

        But then, all the sudden.... Mello attacked!
        And they journeyed long and far too reach their destined encounter with fate which was foresaw by a soothsayer with the ability to predict the future that hasn't happened yet!!....
        .
        "We must journey now to yonder to defeat thee the evil commander of evil and to defeat thee and return spread our magic to this realm of Earth!"
        "Yes, Letus the final battle commencement start!"
        ---
        Later, Felusional and Flopsie were alone again.
        "Its Later" said Flopsie, pulling Felusional towards the bathroom.
        "But what about the others?"
        "I'll just tell them you are helping me shower. They wont suspect a thing"
        "True. They are all idiots"
        Then, suddenly, Flopsie was naked. Felusional wondered how He did that. He must have been nearly naked this whole time!
        The shower turned on...
        ..Felusional was already.

        Flopsie lathered up good and fine. The soap dripped off His body at a seductively slow pace. Felusional could not contain the powerful urge of excitement that raced through Her veins.
        The alluring look of her nudie comrade became too much for her to fathom and her body started sweeting.

        There Felusional sat, Her gold pants pulled quickly down at his ankles, on a toilet full of poop with Her bodly fluids on full display, eyes bulging from Her face.
        Flopsie giggled as Felusional's dignity shriveled and died, but Felusional had always enjoyed that delightful snicker, even after She found out He was Her own flesh and blood.
        "Well...wh-what do we do now?" Felusional said, desperately trying to sound suave.
        "It. We do it."
        "it?"
        "yes. it"
        "we do it?"
        "yes"
        "oh"
        ...and with that Flopsie jumped on Felusional. What little remained of their clothes plopped of quickly. Some fell in the toilet.


        When it was over they cleaned themselves, the room and the nearby warehouse down.
        It took awhile - fortunately they finished before any of their friends got back. So their little secret was safe...for now.
        ---
        So they defeated Mello and everyone was satisfied!

        Mello: what do you mean, it's not over yet?! I'm invincible!
        Serenity: No No, back into your coffin!
        Mello: Grrrr. You will never get me in my box. I am too large and too sexy!
        Author: Ohh no, it looks like the characters still want a story!
        Serenity: of course we do! Or cake. I love cake!
        Mello: Well I'm gonna steal your cake!
        Serenity: Noooo! Whats going to be my dinner now!?
        Mello: mhuahahaha, life isn't worht living without caaaaaaaaake, so just die already will you?!
        Serenity: OK, Ur right, life isn't worth living without the awesomeness of cake. Farewell bitter world of cakelessness!
        Ryuzaki: chotto mate-ah!
        Mello: huh ;^_^;
        Misa Amane: domo desu-ka @_@?
        Serenity: Caaaaaake, need cake. Like brains, but cake!
        Ryuzaki: well, I want you, how about that?
        Ryuzaki winked at Serenity, but Serenity wasn't into men .
        But Misa Amane was all hot 'n that, Serenity thought. So
        Serenity Left the fanfic and looked for a nice bed to crawl into together and maybe more
        The end
