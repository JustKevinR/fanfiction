    <h1>Escape From New Mexico</h1>
    <div class="txt">


        In the darkness of that night, away from the preying eyes and ears of those who would judge, some strangers slipped by unnoticed.

        But they were not strangers, they knew each-other. And they knew each-other much closer then any of their friends did realize.
        They knew each-other both inside and out. But their friends did not know this. Their friends could not know. Their friends should not know this.
        Nor could they know. Because it was night, and thus away from their viscous, judging eyeballs.

        "Is it safe?" said the first stranger, who was not a stranger to the other stranger but will remain a stranger to us for the moment.

        "I think so. Its dark so none of the others should see us here, even if they are nearby. I think our secret is safe."

        "Good. I couldn't take their judgement right now. My life is too stressful as it is. If it wasn't for you I don't know what Id do."
        "Don't worry Flopsie, I will always be here for you - waiting in the dark"
        "Thanks, Skyler. I will always be in the dark for you too"

        With that the two shadows embraced - an embracement in the night full of passion and romance.
        It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...it was sexy times!
        For a moment time seemed to slowed down. Flopsie wondered why. Flopsie turned around slowly (due to the time seeming to have slowed down).
        Then the explanation - Mrs  White was secretly looking at him. Looking at him in that special way.
        Flopsies soul lit up like a beacon in the night - even though it was day.

        In all of this. In all of this mess. They had eachother, even if eachother was the only ones that knew.
        Mrs  White turned away at that moment - Time jumped back to normal as Flopsie was no longer transfixiated by Mrs  White.
        Fortunately no one else had noticed.
        On the day his mansion was attacked with milltary force, Flopsies son had been sleeping untill 7 am.
        Normally he got up at 4 to do his homework, because Flopsie had raised him as a good boyafter his mother died in mysterious circumstances all those years ago.

        Everyone else was already up.

        Wiese, Flopsie's daughter, was already making them all fried breakfirst with syrup. She was dressed in her favorate furry,ancient shirt (nothing under) and thong. Her curves glisted softly in the light of the morning. Normaly she would walk around naked, or at least, topless, as she wasnt ashamed of her perfect body. But it was cold today, as could be seen by looking at her nipples. She rubbed the syrup on herself. She liked that sort of thing.
        Wiese was an expert bio-chemist, her parents were proud. She was going to a school for gifted and thats all that mattered to them.
        They didnt mind that she was a bit wild at times.
        Sometimes bringing home different sex partners each night, sometimes many at a time.
        At 11, she now knew shitloads of langerages, four ancient , 4 computer and 3 sign langerages.
        She found it easy, and learnt them with her dad together.


        By now, Flopsie was now up and standing on the porch with his shirt off. He stared out over the wide desert landscape, he was handsome in a rugged kinda way.
        Once, long ago, he was ranked one of the best special forces soldiers in the world. He was no longer a soldier, and now lived a quite life treasure hunting.
        He was troubled by a newspaper artical his read a few days ago, that mentioned  that someone from New Mexico was killed in a massive war . He was one of the few people that knew that that shouldnt happen, because of a magic spell he cast with Blue Meth a few years ago.
        The Blue Meth was now hidden in his garrage.
        Flopsie was disturbed from his deep thinking by Wiese tugging on his shirt.
        "Father! Father! Look!"
        Wiese pointed urgently at the horizon.
        "Frell!"
        Para-ninjas Hundreds of them!
        They were coming straight at his house.
        He ran inside and bolted the bullet proof front door.
        He woke his son up, and told everyone to run out the back.
        They woke their pilot, who happened to be sleeping in the next room.

         "Quick! Start the Blimp! We are under attack!"
         "OMG" He said as Saul run out. Naked. As Normal. His morning erection would have been poking out from his trousers had he been wearing any.
         He ran back in with his helmit.
         "Holy Shit!".
        Flopsie, meanwhile, triggered an explosion around his garrage in order to hide his precious Blue Meth. The rocks fell and burried it totaly secretly so no one would find it. (None of the soliders heard the explosion as they were looking the other way)
         Meanwhile, the invading force drew closer.
        Flopsie and his family ran to the hanger, Wiese leading the way with her tommygun
         They dodged the soldiers as they ran, ducking and diving between the gunfire.
         "Dont worry! We are almost there!".
         They dived into their escape vechile, guns blazing.
         Their was a soldier already there, but Wiese whackd him.
         "Good job!" Flopsie said, as he pushed him out.
         They started up, and zoomed off, the invading force vanishing into the distance.
         "Did you get the secret message?"
         "Yes, my good friend Jesse told me that Todd was behind this!".
         "We gota deal with this as a family, else we can never live in piece".
         So they joined onwards, their enemy's in hot pursuit!

        But what started out as a fun adventure, turned out to be actually much worse.....

        Because Flopsie may not have suspected it, but Skyler had been collusioning against them all along.

        Because one night, Mrs  White went to Todd Alquist and they both created a masterflue plan. Oh, if only Flopsie knew that Skyler and Todd were working together. Then they would be able to stop themselves from falling even more in love with Skyler than they already had.

        Flopsie went to the armory (He had it build last week after being tired of all the enemas attacking them) and took a good look at all the weapons He could use. Flintlock revolver of all sorts, Bows with sharp edges that could be used as a melee weapon as well as a ranged one, a large assault rigle with automatic and semi automatic modes. But Flopsie had no interest in those. No, Flopsie knew that something bad was about to happen. Flopsie felt it down right across His spine. So Flopsie took the only weapon that truly spoke to their fear and ancientedly; the dark golden katana
        But little did Flopsie know that in fact, the sharpness of the blade was deacided by the amount of love the weilder received (and so if Flopsie would be weilding it andMrs  White didn't actually love Him, it wasn't sharp at all! Which is the case!)
        Some time later in their secret hide-away ;

        "I am glade we found a way to survive all that and still be together"
        "Yes, our plan seems to have worked despite all the events"
        "Do you think anyone spotted us?"
        "No"
        "No"
        "Yes"
        Wiese emerged from the shadows of the darkness.
        "I know everything" she said.
        Flopsie and Mrs  White gasped. Their secret was finally revealed!

        "I dont love Mrs  White like you do" said Wiese "but I have always lusted a bit after them. So you see if Mrs  White spends the night with me - I will never tell anyone."
        Flopsie breathed a sigh of relief. That was, after all, a reasonable request. They agreed to the bargain.
        "Phwee...thats something we can go along with" said Skyler White relieved.
        Wiese was happy, and Flopsie and Mrs  White thus got to live happily ever after together. With no one but Wiese and themselves ever knowing.
        Flopsie took the moterbike towards Todd's Hanger

        When Flopsie arrived, he saw that Skyler was waiting in front of the Todd's condo already.

        Not knowing about Skyler White 's conspiracy, he greeting the loyal woman and said "I see you've alredy geared up! I've brought some additional things along. Here, take this," Flopsie said and gave Mrs  White  the legendery dark golden Katamaran.

        For a brief moment, Flopsie was confused. Skyler White's really didn't seem to want to accept the blade.
        "No, this is for you. You should weild this holy balde!"
        "Nonsense, Flopsie said, "our love is so strong, this blade is the fierest of evertyhign. I want you to be safe. And I want you.... to follow in my footsteps as the greatest warrior of all."

        "This is truly too much,"Skyler said. For a brief moment, Flopsie thought  Skyler's eyes were a bit shifty. Was their love not the greatest?

        But quickly Flopsie didn't continue thinking about it. How dare he get this idea in his head? Their love was the greatest

        So Flopsie went in and defeated all the Minions and thethingy that Todd had hired until they finally came to the Conservatory Todd was hiding in.

        But there the betrayal started. Mrs  White raised the sword. Flopsie turned around.
        "Prepare to die! Skyler shouted.

        Hahaa! said Flopsie, "But you can't kill me. Because the only way this sword works, is through the strength of love.

        "Indeed, Flopsie said Skyler. The strength of the love of the other! And with one fierce sweep, Skyler stabbed Flopsie. "The love of the other!" Mrs  White said.

        Because it was true, Flopsie still loved Skyler very much. And that love now. That was his undooing.

        Todd kicked Flopsie once more. And then Flopsie died.

        The end.
