        Flopsie rememberd the abuse he suffered as a child.
        His parents never loved him, Flopsie knew. Always telling him off for anything he did.
        And that would continue until one day, Flopsie's parents were killed   in a car accident. He was then forced to live with his uncle and aunt.
        They forced him to live in the basement. And every night he would cry himself to sleep as no one in the world loved him.
        Flopsie was also forced to do all the work around the house. But still it wasn't enough to deserve his uncle and aunts love. And so soon, they send him to a orphanage.

        Flopsie didn't think life could get worse, but there he learned that life still had more horror in store for him.
        Because the orphanage turned out to be really a secret front for a highly criminal organisation! And they put all the children there to work in their factories and their mines.
        And Flopsie too was set to work. Despite the horror of the orphanage, he was finally in a place where others were treated just as badly as he was. Hopefully, finally Flopsie could make some real friends, he thought.
        But that thought too turned to merely a fantasy. As the kids soon saw that Flopsie was not like them. Flopsie was special. And the kids hated him for it.
        And so every night, when the kids would return from the factories and mines, they would force Flopsie to work more. Or to do their beds. Or to clean the showers and the toilets.
        And whenever something would go wrong, the kids said to the guards: "Flopsie did it!" and the guards, who also hated Flopsie for being so special, believed them and hurt Flopsie.

        And so Flopsie thought that no one in the world would love him. Until one day, a organisation of superheroes attacked the criminals and freed all the kids.
        And they also freed Flopsie!

        And they said: "Don't worry, kid, we'll take care of you."
        "We'll train you and you'll become a part of the family!"

        Or will he?
        In the darkness of that night, away from the preying eyes and ears of those who would judge, some strangers slipped by unnoticed.

        But they were not strangers, they knew each-other. And they knew each-other much closer then any of their friends did realize.
        They knew each-other both inside and out. But their friends did not know this. Their friends could not know. Their friends should not know this.
        Nor could they know. Because it was night, and thus away from their viscous, judging eyeballs.

        "Is it safe?" said the first stranger, who was not a stranger to the other stranger but will remain a stranger to us for the moment.

        "I think so. Its dark so none of the others should see us here, even if they are nearby. I think our secret is safe."

        "Good. I couldn't take their judgement right now. My life is too stressful as it is. If it wasn't for you I don't know what Id do."
        "Don't worry Flopsie, I will always be here for you - waiting in the dark"
        "Thanks, Lisa Lisa. I will always be in the dark for you too"

        With that the two shadows embraced - an embracement in the night full of passion and romance.


        Flopsie was then taken in by a super secret organisation, called Green Lantern Corps. For a while, it looked like Flopsie was just at home.

        Flopsie got to train with all the other secret superheroes. He was trained in all sorts of things, ranging from Chemistry to using the Ozis

        The other recruits didn't want to socialise with Flopsie. They hated him for how quickly Flopsie mastered the musket and how well trained Flopsie was in compare to the others. What Flopsie neglected to tell them was that the only reason why he was so good, was because of Flopsie s horrible childhood.

        One day, Flopsie was called forward.
        Flopsie had just succesfully accomplished the most difficult part of his training. So good, Flopsie had beaten the previous high score!
        Flopsie knew that now that he had beaten the previous high score, he was sure to get a place on the greatest team the world had ever seen.
        So Flopsie went to him commander-in-chief, Jean Pierre Polnareff.
        But when Flopsie got there, suddenly there was more than Jean Pierre Polnareff. There were also others.

        Flopsie said: "What's going on?"
        "Don't worry," captain Jean Pierre Polnareff said. "It's all going to be all right."

        But Flopsie knew this had to be a trap! That much he had learned from his horrible childhood.
        Quickly Flopsie kicked the table into Jean Pierre Polnareff's chest. Trish tried to stop him but Flopsie was too quick and took a gun from the wall (there were like loads of guns and other weapons displayed on the wall).
        "I won't let you do this to me," Flopsie said gravely. "I will be free!"

        The others didn't want to risk being shot. And Flopsie took the file from the desk that had his name on it. And then Flopsie ran. Away from Green Lantern Corps and away from the other recruits.

        And Flopsie was right not to trust them! For when he looked in the file, it turned out they were planning on selling Flopsie out to DIO!

        But what was Flopsie to do now? All alone in this world, who could Flopsie trust now?

        Stay turned!!!
        For a moment time seemed to slowed down. Flopsie wondered why. Flopsie turned around slowly (due to the time seeming to have slowed down).
        Then the explanation - Lisa Lisa was secretly looking at him. Looking at him in that special way.
        Flopsies soul lit up like a beacon in the night - even though it was day.

        In all of this. In all of this mess. They had eachother, even if eachother was the only ones that knew.
        Lisa Lisa turned away at that moment - Time jumped back to normal as Flopsie was no longer transfixiated by Lisa Lisa.
        Fortunately no one else had noticed.
        Some time later in their secret hide-away ;

        "I am glade we found a way to survive all that and still be together"
        "Yes, our plan seems to have worked despite all the events"
        "Do you think anyone spotted us?"
        "No"
        "No"
        "Yes"
        Serenity emerged from the shadows of the darkness.
        "I know everything" she said.
        Flopsie and Lisa Lisa gasped. Their secret was finally revealed!

        "I dont love Lisa Lisa like you do" said Serenity "but I have always lusted a bit after them. So you see if Lisa Lisa spends the night with me - I will never tell anyone."
        Flopsie breathed a sigh of relief. That was, after all, a reasonable request. They agreed to the bargain.
        "Phwee...thats something we can go along with" said Lisa Lisa relieved.
        Serenity was happy, and Flopsie and Lisa Lisa thus got to live happily ever after together. With no one but Serenity and themselves ever knowing.
        Flopsie sat down on the pavement. It was raining loudly and people were hurrying down towards home, of course ignoring his sobbing.

        The world had been unusually cruel to Flopsie. First his horrific childhood where he was treated like nothing more than a slave. Then the disappointing time at the Green Lantern Corps. It all became a bit too much for Flopsie, so he put on his iphone player and listened to the soothing tunes, like Like a Virgin and A Whole New World .

        Then all the sudden, footstepts approached Flopsie but he didn't hear it because of the music.
        Flopsie then looked up and looked at a mysterious figure wearing a long rain coat.

        "Whats wrong, kiddo," said the mysterious stranger.
        "I'm fed up with life," said Flopsie. I'm so good at everything, but everyone hates me for it. I can't keep going anymore."
        And then with the softest voice, Flopsie spoke the darkest truth: "I don't want to live anymore."

        The stranger laughed loudly, "ohhohohoh, don't worry dear Flopsie. Life will turn out better for you."
        "How do you know," Flopsie asked.
        "Because the world hates me too," the stranger said and with one swoop the stranger removed his coat. It was DIO!

        "OMG," Flopsie said outraged.
        "Calm down, young one," DIO said. "I too am misunderstood."

        "Oh, I suppose that oculd be true," said Flopsie.
        "Now, come with me," DIO said and reached out for Flopsie. "Let me take care of u. We're sole mates, you and I. The world is against us, but together we can fight for our freedom!"
        "For freedom!" Flopsie said as he accepted DIOs hand.

        And together they went off. Flopsie was finally happy.
