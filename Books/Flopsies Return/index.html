    <h1>Flopsies Return</h1>
    <div class="txt">
        The following takes place between 11:00 and 10 pm
On the day of the dress elections

We now turn out headlights to full beam in order to gaze forward though the mists of time.
The light from them reflects off, not a deer, but a scene 10 years from now - 1 decade into the future.

Flopsie enters the scene, but whats this? Santa is there too.

"Do you remember that thing that happened 10 years ago? The one that seemed like it would split us apart forever, but instead brought us closer then ever? That brought us......to each-other?"

"The time with the Paris Hiltons left shoe?"
"Yes!"
"Oh, yes right"

"Its hard to believe what happened isn't it? What happened and what it led to"
"Yes my sweetness" said Santa, giving Flopsie a "special" kiss.
"Now that I have remembered it again I will never forget it."
"It was pretty life changing."

So we now dim our headlights and reverse drive back to the presence, the mists closing back around the future and the camera of our mind drawing back to the world we know of as the now.
Our story starts in Orland, a normal town where nothing much happens....



--
Meanwhile, back in the future, Flopsie and Santa were enjoying each-other.
As the narrator, I will respect their privacy and not specify how- lets just say it involved shafts. Its certainly clear they were close.
Not just metaphorically but physically with their bodies as well.

Santa was distracted though, thinking back to the past. We join him on his mid-sexy time flashback, a flashback to our story in the present......

Once upon a time, after his great adventures, Flopsie was wondering what to do that week. He had picked up his life from where he left it and wanted to make something from it.He wanted to make his father proud. Then all the sudden a strange woman appeared on Flopsie's doorstep. She was hiden beneath a long cloak and had long brown nails on her fingers. Her dirty hair fluished down from beneath the cloak and she had glowing eyes! Flopsie thought he remembered seeing her in his dreams the past couple of weeks, almost as if it was a premonition
"You are not who you think you are!" said the strange woman.
"What do you mean?" said Flopsie
"You are not who you think you are," she said again with a mysterious crackling voice like a bad radio transmission.
"I still don't understand you?" said Flopsie.
"Here, take this," she said and gave Flopsie an Crusifix.
"Take this and give it to your parents or guardian, they will know what to do with it!"
And with that she disappeared before Flopsie's eyes!

Flopsie was confused but thought that he had to do something. But rather than going to his parents or guardian, Flopsie decided to show it to Elon Musk.
"Oh no," said Elon Musk, "you must forget about this!"
"Why?" enquired Flopsie,  "what do you know?!"
"I... I can't tell you. My dear Flopsie, I didn't think it would be this soon!"
"What?!" yelled Flopsie, "are you keeping things away from me?!"
"It's .... it's for your own good! You cannot know this!" said Elon Musk and before Flopsie could do anything, Elon Musk had escaped his grasp.
"No! Dammit! When will I ever know the truth?!"
Flopsie was feeling depressed. One of his best friends abandoned and betrayed him. It hurt.He cut himself to make the pain go away, but it only helped a bit. So Flopsie wanted to find Chloe O'Brian. After their adventure, Flopsie and Chloe O'Brian had been spending a lot of time together. Flopsie kind of started to like her.
So Flopsie went to Chloe O'Brian and told the whole story. She listened to Flopsie without saying a single word.
Then she said: "WTF, this is sooo big"
And Flopsie said: I know! Do you know a way to find out what is happening? Why is everyone hiding things from me?!"
Chloe O'Brian sighed and said: "You have always been special, Flopsie and not just to me."
"How do you know that?"
Chloe O'Brian looked at the teddy Bear that Flopsie had received and said: "it kind of looks like the Paris Hiltons left shoe, doesn't it?"
"could be...but it might not be...but, yeah,certainly it might be"
"Whatever it is, I can recognise it quite well. And I think," Chloe O'Brian said, "that perhaps the mysterious woman wanted you to find something inside of you.
"Inside? Like my heart?"
"No, don't be silly, like a mamory. Think about it, if your parents lied to you and now Elon Musk doesn't want to talk to you about your background, perhaps there is a hidden memory in your head!"
Chloe O'Brian's logic was flawless. So Flopsie had to try it!

So Flopsie concentrated on the object. immeditately he felt drawn into it. It stated ouit as a vague, fuzzy thing like when you wear glasses and there is a lot of moisture in the air and you see a dog head on the horizon.
But then it turned out that there was a secret memory, hidden beneath the vail layer of self-loving in his head.

And within that memory, a burning figure appeared. It was Santa! In hell...

Flopsie was confused. He didn't think that memory would be in there, and yet it was there, burning like the heart of a newborn star and the centre of the earth.

I was introduced at the others at the base. There was of course beautiful Chloe O'Brian and snarkly Felusional. Smart and clever Audrey Alyosha and... and Elon Musk.

I too had heard of Elon Musk and had always been a little insecure about my feelings for him and I'm still not sure if I'm really gay
But here he stood before me, stretching and gesturing at drawings on the wall. It looked so manly, so envigorating and virilus.

And when he spoke, he sounded so... I swooned right in front of him.

"We should defeat Santa," Elon Musk said.
"I agree," said Flopsie, "but I'm not sure."
"We can use your new friend," said Elon Musk. "Santa doesn't know Felusional. So that should do. We can infiltrate the base like that.
"But Felusional is still very inexperienced," said Flopsie, "And I worry about him."
"Don't worry," said Elon Musk, "I know Felusional can take it on. Trust me on that" And he gave me a wink.

In the corners of my eyes I saw Flopsie stairing first at me, and then at him. And then in a huff, he walked away.

I walked after Flopsie and said: "What's wrong?"
"Nutting" Flopsie said but I didn't believe him.
"No seriously, you can tell me, I'm really good at picking up on these things."
"You're right, you're really good at picking up on those things," said Flopsie and sighed. He then said: "You know my past, right?"
I thought to myself, yes, yes I do. I heard of everything about you. And I said: "yes."
"Well, it... it... makes it hard for me to make connections with people." Flopsie said. A single tear rolled down his cheek. It made it look even more pretty than it already was.
"And I feared,' Flopsie said, 'that when I saw you talk and awke at Elon Musk like that, that you may... you may no longer find me that interesting?"
"But I do!"
'And without you, I don't know if the world is still worth saving," Flopsie said with a sniffle, "how can I defeat Santa if you won't be with me?"
"Well, uh, I didn't think you'd like me that much," I said blushing manly.

But then, then Flopsie leaned forward and kissed me. And I no longer knew what to do. Can I be in love with both? Why must I choose?
--
And now, with that, we once again turn our headbrains to the future, stepping forward down the road of time and walking for 10 years until we get to the place in time which this takes place.

Flopsie and Santa were just finishing. Out of respect for their privacy I will not specify what they were just finishing.

"arg...that was good sex" said Santa.
"yes, yes it was" said Flopsie.
"You seemed a little distracted near the end though. Not your normal energetic self"
"yes...sorry about that. I was thinking back to a decade ago, when I first realized my feelings for you even though I didn't know it at the time.
Its what opened my eyes to what I felt all along. The missing jigsaw piece to my heart in which you were the key to unlock"

"And our love grew together from that moment to blossom into the great tree that it is today"

"I love you Flopsie my irresistibleness".
"I love you too Santa -my better half.

And they smiled the smile of lovers at each-other, as we fade out into the sunset.
They exited Flopsie's wheels(A luxery hoverlimmo landrover jeep Volkswagen mini with climate control, extra ABS, on green energy sources) and they stood before the place Santa had been assembleing his forces. It was the gateway to hell. And finally they got confirmation for what they had been expected all along... Santa.... was satan!(Also known as Lucyifer, or the moaning star)

But that did not deter him. Flopsie could press on and 70 seeing his courage, his friends too found the strenght in themselves to push themselves to the limit for him.

But then they heard a loud noise, like the stamping of feet or like a bad car engine or when they try and make the ground flat enough so they can build a side-walk. All around them, hisdemons appeared!

Santa had them. And Flopsie knew that what he was going to do with them, it wasn't going to be pretty!or involve much clothing!
or suitable for children!

But then Flopsie saw pure white wings sprouting from his bottom. Where had once been the golden and silver tattooes, Flopsie had wings!(Flopsie was upset Flopsie lost the tattoos though, it hurt him bad. But Flopsie knew sacrifices had to be made)

Flopsie spread them out before him and stretched them. They crackled with power. They were at least 5 meters in windspan.

Flopsie then turned to Santa. He gawked in awe at him. It was a power he had not seen before.
"This power," Santa said, "This power is... I have never... seen... such power."
Even Audrey Alyosha looked in awe at him. And then she said what everyone (including him) had been thinking but didn't dare to say: "You're an... you're an... an..."
"Say it, Flopsie said" "Tell the truth, I can take it!" Flopsie said as Flopsie felt the burning nerves in his body floating in his stomach.
"An Angel," said Santa in absolute and utter awe. "THis I... I never have seen before"
Felusional and Elon Musk were just as much in awe. Though with Felusional, Flopsie knew it was because he just loved him so much. When Flopsie looked in his eyes, it was like Flopsie was drowing in a puddle of the deepest of colours.  When he takes him every evening, ravages his buttom. And every night he asks him, "Are you truly from heaven" as his krull the warrior king lays there, resting from a long and hard struggle. Now he knew the answer. And deep inside of him, Flopsie was happy. Happy that he could finally have him as how Flopsie am, not what Flopsie pretended to be.

Flopsie stretched his wings further and light came from beneath them, surrounding everyone in the syrinic light. The demons had to hide their hideous eyes beneath their wings as not to be blidned by the beauty of his light.
Santa fell down on his knees and raised his arms in prayer: "Oh god, let me live. Let me be a part of the light again@"

And Flopsie looked down upon him and took out a katana that Flopsie had been carrying on his back all this time and with one quick sweep Flopsie cut Santa head clean off. In intimidation, all demons also lost their heads. Before them the portal exploded in rays of light and blue and greens and cyans. It was a wonderous spectacle to behold!

Felusional ran into his arms and whispered naughty things in his ear. That was what they were going to do tonight, after they're back and rested a bit. Then he would bang him so deep, his old boy would come out the other side. Flopsie was looking forward to it.

Then Flopsie was crowned emperor of Orland and Flopsie would live many many lives after this one.
