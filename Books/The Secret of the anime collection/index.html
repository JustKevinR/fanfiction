        Hinata was in the shower.
        She rubed her firm, perfectly shaped Jumbo chickpeas as the water cascaded over her sexy shiny body.The bubbles from the soap breifly obscured the pinicals of them before she rinced it off...the clear water making her pretty skin shiny in the sunlight coming from the open window She stretched upwards, making her C-cup Big boppers look even bigger.  She had long wanted even bigger breasts as she was jealous of Sakura.
        Meanwhile Sakura was walking by Hinata house, in Konoha
        She saw steam coming from the window, and went over the look...after all, the house could have been on fire!
        She looked unto the window. She gazed unto the crystal glass and beholded a wonder of nature
        Suddenly, Flopsie walked in.
         As Flopsie was undressed by the girls, he examined them carefully
        "You know, i never noticed how firm and big your breasts are!"
         "Why dont you feel them"
         "Can I feel more?"
        "Only if you let us feel you a bit!", she reached down and grabbed
         "you can pleasure us, while we watched and feel eachover...we need a big strong man like you to forfill us"   Flopsie' thrusted his huge equipment into both of them one at a time, as the girls rubbed eachothers attic softly.
         This went on for 4 hours, before the girls got tired.
         "thank you"
         "Dont mention it"

         Sakura turned the h0t shower off, and they all walked into the living room.
         Flopsie' put his cloaths on, but Sakura and Hinata stayed naked.
         "What did you come here for anyway?"
         "Oh, yes, i came here to tell you Orochimaru has returned, and i need your help to defeat him"
        "ok, we will get our cloaths on and follow you on your erotic quest!"
         "No time for that!, you will have to stay naked."
         "oh, thats ok, gives us more time to admire our hot female bodys"
        "yes, I love running around naked, my breasts bounce around in circular paturns"
        "Wed do anything for you snuggems."
         "ok lets go!!!!"
         "ok"
         "ok!"
         "ok!"
         And they left to beging the start of the first chapter in their epic quest.
        "You know, I think Orochimarus naphew would be better bustier dont you think?"  said Sakura.
        "No, you have to understand he is longer than some Gameboys." replied Ekler.
        "True."
        "What ARE you talking about?" said Flopsie.
        And they all laughed.


         Our heroes arrived at Orochimaru. He just stood there.
         Its time you saw my true form, mortals.
         "Mortals?" said Sasuke
         "What does he mean?"
         "Maha. Fools...behold..."
         With that he ripped his mask off!
        and his face!
         His horns sprung up,  he was actually Satan all along!

         "I love you" said Flopsie;
         "What?" said Satan, supprised
         "I love you" said Shikamaru.
         "I love too" said Ekler.
         "I love as well!" said Orochimaru.
         "What? Noo...ARRRGGG" screamed Satan
         Satan ::  exploded in a shower of hearts!
          "Not even Satan can defeat the power of Love"
        As Satan exploded Flopsie sudden saw Orochimaru again in the middle of the explosion.
        "Orochimaru!"
        "Its me, Orochimaru. First Satan was inside me and then got out, but during then I was inside Satan. You exploded Satan so only the inside was left which was me."
        "Do we need to fight now?"
        "No, when I was inside Satan before you exploded him I still heard what you said. What you said about love and The Lord. And how we all have to be good to be saved by him. I want peace now. I have seen the light"
        "Oh, thats good, Love has shown you the way"

        And with that Orochimaru and Flopsie became friends. Orochimaru got baptised the following week and Flopsie helped out. After that they had some cucumbers and went home.

        The End.
